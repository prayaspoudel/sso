## Why We Archived These Files

To improve documentation maintainability and user experience, we consolidated all documentation into a single, comprehensive README.md file. This provides:

1. **Single Source of Truth**: No confusion about where to find information
2. **Better Navigation**: Table of contents with quick links
3. **Consistency**: Unified formatting and structure
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Update once, not across multiple files
5. **Better Search**: All content searchable in one file

These archived files are kept for reference but should not be used going forward.
